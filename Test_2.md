### My proudest achievement

Back in 2016 I was working on a CRM tool at trivago where we were importing data
on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Those imports where not taking so much time
when the dataset was small but once it started growing they were taking ages, so I started a refactor of the queries to improve the speed from 1 hour to 10 minutes in the worst case (the monthly process).

The development team was really happy after I shared what I learned and what I did to improve the queries so we all learned, that's why I feel very proud of this.
